# RL-for-BESS-Participation-in-the-Imbalance-Settlement
This repository gathers codes for the control of a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) in the Imbalance Settlement (IS) using Reinforcement Learning (RL). 

The TD3_agent_git.py files is the main script that can be run to train and test a TD3 agent based on Belgian IS data also provided in this repository. All useful functions and classes are in the file Classes_TD3_git.py.

This script is one of the original building block that was used for the paper : C. Rasic, P. Favaro, Y. Wang and J. -F. Toubeau, "Safe Reinforcement Learning for Battery Energy Storage Participation in the Imbalance Settlement," in IEEE Transactions on Energy Markets, Policy and Regulation, doi: 10.1109/TEMPR.2025.3639758.
The actual codes of the paper, including Safe Projetion mechanisms, are expected to be added in the future in this repository. For any earlier interest regarding the codes of the paper, please contact Cyril Rasic (cyril.rasic@umons.ac.be).
